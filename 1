| In this lesson, we'll briefly introduce basics of statistical inference, the process of drawing conclusions "about a
| population using noisy statistical data where uncertainty must be accounted for". In other words, statistical
| inference lets scientists formulate conclusions from data and quantify the uncertainty arising from using incomplete
| data.

  |=================================                                                                              |  30%
| So statistical inference involves formulating conclusions using data AND quantifying the uncertainty associated with
| those conclusions. The uncertainty could arise from incomplete or bad data.

  |============================================                                                                   |  40%
| Which of the following would NOT be a source of bad data?

1: A randomly selected sample of population
2: Small sample size
3: Selection bias
4: A poorly designed study

Selection: 3

| Not exactly. Give it another go.

| Which of the choices would allow one to draw reasonable inferences?

1: Small sample size
2: Selection bias
3: A poorly designed study
4: A randomly selected sample of population

| Keep up the great work!

| So with statistical inference we use data to draw general conclusions about a population. Which of the following would
| a scientist using statistical inference techniques consider a problem?

1: Contaminated data
2: Our data sample is representative of the population
3: Our study has no bias and is well-designed

| We want to emphasize a couple of important points here. First, a statistic (singular) is a number computed from a
| sample of data. We use statistics to infer information about a population. Second, a random variable is an outcome
| from an experiment. Deterministic processes, such as computing means or variances, applied to random variables,
| produce additional random variables which have their own distributions. It's important to keep straight which
| distributions you're talking about.

  |=========================================================================================                      |  80%
| Finally, there are two broad flavors of inference. The first is frequency, which uses "long run proportion of times an
| event occurs in independent, identically distributed repetitions." The second is Bayesian in which the probability
| estimate for a hypothesis is updated as additional evidence is acquired. Both flavors require an understanding of
| probability so that's what the next lessons will cover.
