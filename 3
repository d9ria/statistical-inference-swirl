| Recall that a random variable is a numerical outcome of an experiment. It can be discrete (take on only a countable
| number of possibilities), or continuous (take on any value on the real line or subset of it).

...

| Continuous random variables are usually associated with measurements of time, distance, or some biological process
| since they can take on any value, often within some specified range. Limitations of precision in taking the
| measurements may imply that the values are discrete; we in fact consider them continuous.

...

  |===================                                                                                            |  17%
| A probability mass function (PMF) gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some
| value.

| For instance, suppose we have a coin which may or may not be fair. Let x=0 represent a 'heads' outcome and x=1
| represent a 'tails' outcome of a coin toss. If p is the probability of 'heads' which of the following represents the
| PMF of the coin toss?  The variable x is either 0 (heads) or 1 (tails).

  |=========================                                                                                      |  23%
| A probability density function is associated with a continuous random variable. To quote from Wikipedia, it "is a
| function that describes the relative likelihood for this random variable to take on a given value. The probability of
| the random variable falling within a particular range of values is given by ... the area under the density function
| but above the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the range."

...

  |=============================                                                                                  |  26%
| We'll repeat two requirements of a probability density function. It must be nonnegative everywhere, and the area under
| it must equal one."

...

  |================================                                                                               |  29%
| Consider this figure - a rectangle with height 1 and width 2 with a diagonal line drawn from the lower left corner
| (0,0) to the upper right (2,1). The area of the entire rectangle is 2 and elementary geometry tells us that the
| diagonal divides the rectangle into 2 equal areas.

...

  |===================================                                                                            |  31%
| Could the diagonal line represent a probability density function for a random variable with a range of values between
| 0 and 2? Assume the lower side of the rectangle is the x axis.

  |======================================                                                                         |  34%
| Now consider the shaded portion of the triangle - a smaller triangle with a base of length 1.6 and height determined
| by the diagonal. We'll answer the question, "What proportion of the big triangle is shaded?"

...

  |=========================================                                                                      |  37%
| This proportion represents the probability that throwing a piece of cat kibble at the bigger triangle (below the
| diagonal) hits the blue portion.

...

  |============================================                                                                   |  40%
| We have to compute the area of the blue triangle. (Since the area of the big triangle is 1, the area of the blue
| triangle is the proportion of the big triangle that is shaded.) We know the base, but what is its height?

2: .25
3: .8

| This artificial example was meant to illustrate a simple probability density function (PDF). Most PDFs have underlying
| formulae more complicated than lines. We'll see more of these in future lessons.

| The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable X, either discrete or continuous, is the function F(x)
| equal to the probability that X is less than or equal to x. In the example above, the area of the blue triangle
| represents the probability that the random variable was less than or equal to the value 1.6.

| If you're familiar with calculus you might recognize that when you're computing areas under curves you're actually
| integrating functions.

  |===================================================================                                            |  60%
| When the random variable is continuous, as in the example, the PDF is the derivative of the CDF. So integrating the
| PDF (the line represented by the diagonal) yields the CDF. When you evaluate the CDF at the limits of integration the
| result is an area.

| To see this in the example, we've defined the function mypdf for you. This is the equation of the line represented by
| the diagonal of the rectangle. As the PDF, it is the derivative of F(x), the CDF. Look at mypdf now.

| Now use the R function integrate to integrate mypdf with the parameters lower equal to 0 and upper equal to 1.6. See
| if you get the same area (probability) you got before.

| The survivor function S(x) of a random variable X is defined as the function of x equal to the probability that the
| random variable X is greater than the value x. This is the complement of the CDF F(x), in our example, the portion of
| the lower triangle that is not shaded.
